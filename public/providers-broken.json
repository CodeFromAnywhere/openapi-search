      "description": "The Customer Data Pipeline (CDP) is a service that allows users to upload data to the platform. It allows users to specify `Destination`s to which the data should be sent, and `Source`s from which the data is sent from the client.\n\nDestinations can be of type 'webhook' only currently. The CDP service will send a POST request to the webhook URL with the data in the body of the request. A basic transformation can be specified to transform event data into the format required by the destination."
